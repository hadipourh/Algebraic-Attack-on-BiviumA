# Algebraic-Attack-on-BiviumA
A SageMath script to extract the BiviumA alebraic equations, and solve the extracted system of equations via a SAT solver. 
# Prerequisite
Here the CryptoMiniSat is used as the solver, So if you want to execute this script in your own installed SageMath, you need to install an optional package called cryptominisat on your SageMath, by the following commands.  
```
sage -i cryptominisat
sage -b
```
